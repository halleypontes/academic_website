title: Internet Disorder Scale-Short Form (IDS9-SF)
---
The IDS9-SF **[(Pontes & Griffiths, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.15805/addicta.2016.3.0102)** was developed in a study that involved the participation of 1.100 English-speaking Internet users and it is used to assess Internet addiction and its symptoms according to the nine Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) criteria as suggested by the American Psychiatric Association in the latest edition of the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-5).

The IDS9-SF is a brief unidimensional test that includes a total of nine items. In terms of psychometric properties, the IDS9-SF has been shown to exhibit adequate levels of validity as assessed by means of: (i) factorial validity, (ii) nomological validity, (iii) concurrent validity, and (iv) criterion validity. The IDS9-SF has also been shown to be reliable according to several indicators of internal consistency (all information about the validity of the scale can be found in the original **[study](https://doi.org/10.15805/addicta.2016.3.0102)**).

The IGD9-SF has been widely used in research on Internet addiction and several cross-cultural psychometric studies were conducted to validate the test in other languages. Languages in which the test has been developed so far include:
