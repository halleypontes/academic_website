By using or continuing to use this website, including providing any Personal Data to me, you accept and consent to the rights, obligations, and practices described in this Privacy Policy.


## **Collection of Personal Data**
This website does not require you to identify yourself and it does not actively collect any form of Personal Data from you as it was designed to be fully accessible and operational without compromising your right to privacy. 

However, if you opt to contact me directly via the **[Contact](https://www.halleypontes.com/#contact)** form, you will need to provide minimal Personal Data, including your **name** and **email address** so that I can send you a response.

Please note that you may be also sending Personal Data in case you opt to contact me directly via email and/or via any of the social media platforms listed on this website. Any message and/or Personal Data provided to me by you will be confidentially stored in my email inbox and/or the social media platform you contacted me for potential future correspondence.

If this is not your wish, please either do not contact me or in case you do, explicitly mention in your message to me that you want me to delete your message and/or any Personal Data provided to me by you that I have control of.

All such requests for deletion of messages and/or Personal Data will be complied with. However, when contacting me you should bear in mind the Privacy Policy and Data Retention practices of the service or services you are using to contact me as they may have a different Personal Data and Data Retention policy.

## **Use of cookies and tracking**
This website does not use **[cookies](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)** and does not require you to enable them in order to fully access its contents.

In regards to tracking, I have enabled all possible **[Hugo Privacy-Enhancing options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings)** possible so that third-party services such as Google Analytics are disabled on this website.

## **Sharing of Personal Data**
Unless you explicitly contact me and provide some form of Personal Data, this website does not collect any form of Personal Data that I can share with other stakeholders and/or third parties.

Any message sent to me by you will be kept confidential and will not be shared with anyone unless you are explicitly informed otherwise.

## **Does Privacy matter? Why should I care?**
Privacy and Digital Privacy are basic human rights that everyone should care about, particularly in this day and age where so called big tech companies adopt all sorts of strategies and questionable practices to obtain Personal Data for different purposes.

If you wish to learn more about the importance of Digital Privacy, please visit the **[Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy)** website to learn more about why this matters and why you should care about it.

If you wish to take further action and active steps toward safeguarding your Digital Privacy, please see the recommendations provided by **[privacyguides.org](https://www.privacyguides.org/tools/)**, a a non-profit collective operated entirely by volunteers.
