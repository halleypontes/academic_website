{{% callout note %}}

## **Introduction**
This website was built with the intent to respect your privacy. Because the website was developed using the free and open-access framework **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, you can easily verify the privacy settings implemented here by inspecting the **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/halleypontes/academic_website)** hosting this website.

By using or continuing to use this website, including providing any Personal Data to me, you accept and consent to the rights, obligations, and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## **Collection of Personal Data**
This website does not require you to identify yourself and it does not actively collect any form of Personal Data from you as it was designed to be fully accessible and operational without compromising your right to privacy. 

However, if you opt to contact me directly via the **[Contact](https://www.halleypontes.com/#contact)** form, you will need to provide minimal Personal Data, including your **name** and **email address** so that I can send you a response.

Please note that you may be also sending Personal Data in case you opt to contact me directly via email and/or via any of the social media platforms listed on this website. Any message and/or Personal Data provided to me by you will be confidentially stored in the platform you have used to contact me for potential future correspondence.

If you are not contacting me via this website, please check the Privacy Policy of the service used to contact me as it may differ from this policy.

## **Use of cookies and tracking**
This website does not use **[cookies](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)** and does not require you to enable them in order to fully access its contents.

Note though that most internet browsers allow you to **[enable or disable the use cookies if you wish to do so](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/disable-cookies)**. If your internet browser does not allow you to change your cookies settings, please see the recommendations provided by **[privacyguides.org](https://www.privacyguides.org/)** about the **[Desktop](https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/)** and/or **[Mobile](https://www.privacyguides.org/mobile-browsers/)** browsers that will allow you to take full control of your Digital Privacy.

In regards to tracking, I have enabled all **[Hugo privacy-enhancing options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings)** currently available so that third-party services such as Google Analytics are entirely disabled on this website.

## **Sharing of Personal Data**
Unless you explicitly contact me and provide some form of Personal Data, this website does not collect any form of Personal Data that I can share with other stakeholders and/or third parties.

Any message you sent me by contacting me will be kept confidential and will not be shared with anyone unless you are explicitly informed otherwise.

## **Your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**
Based on the functionalities provided by this website and the current General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) legislation (see documentation **[here](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)**), you have the right to request that any Personal Data you may have sent me by contacting me via this website to be deleted.

If you do not wish to send any Personal Data in the first place, please do not contact me. However, in case you do and also wish to exercise your right to erasure, please send me an **[email](mailto:contactme@halleypontes.com)** requesting that any information and/or Personal Data that I may hold be deleted.

All such deletion requests will be complied with and your request will be acknowledged.
