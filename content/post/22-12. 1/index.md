title: Welcome to my new website!
---
Welcome aboard!

I am really excited to release the new version of my website, which was entirely developed by me in **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**, using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**.

Thanks to the possibilities that FOSS tools like R and Hugo provide, creating a visually appealing website with a modern interface has never been so easy.

I hope we can keep connected and that I have enough time to keep you posted about my adventures in academia and psychology.

In the meantime, I wish you all a happy and joyful Christmas and a truly awesome happy new year!
