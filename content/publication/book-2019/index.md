Dear all, my first book (co-written with Dr. Daria Kuss) titled **'Internet Addiction'** provides a concise overview of the emerging phenomenon of Internet Addiction based on the recent developments in the field. It is written for both specialist and non-specialist audiences (e.g., students, health professionals, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc). See the description of the book below:

> _This book examines how you can identify, assess, and treat Internet addiction in the most effective manner. Internet use has become an integral part of our daily lives, but at what point does Internet use become problematic? What are the different kinds of Internet addiction? And how can professionals best help clients? Internet addiction refers to a range of behavioral problems, including social media addiction and Internet gaming disorder._
>
> _This compact, evidence-based guide written by leading experts from the field helps disentangle the debates and controversies around Internet addiction and outlines the current assessment and treatment methods. The book presents a 12–15 session treatment plan for Internet and gaming addiction using the method and setting with the best evidence: group CBT. Printable tools in the appendix help clinicians implement therapy. This accessible book is essential reading for clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, counsellors, social workers, teachers, as well as students._
